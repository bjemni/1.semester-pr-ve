            <p class="test">
                Where do you imagine all your digital data is stored? Are you aware of the pollution your website is
                making?
                Did you know that colors, pictures and the way your website is coded is more or less polluting our
                globe? Read the following information to understand sustainable web design better.

            <h3>Sustainability is the future</h3>
            <p class="test">
                Research shows that we in Denmark think more and more about sustainability. In fact, we are some of the
                leaders in this field. But how much do we think about digital CO2 footprints? Future multimedia
                designers are going to have a lot more focus on sustainability when it comes to website design. But how?
                As a web designer, you will most often be given a task by a customer. The customer knows nothing about
                what sustainable is in relation to designs. Your task will therefore be to meet the customer's wishes,
                while keeping the website sustainable. The future is fast approaching, and if you want to be at the top
                of web designers, I suggest you brand yourself on sustainability. Create integrity by saying no to
                customers who want polluting websites. Become a trendsetter! Sustainability must become a trend! Use
                darker and faded colors. Limit your consumption of images and videos. Make sure your page loads in sync
                with the user's pattern. Remember less is more! Show that sustainability is the new black!

            <h3>Sustainability around the world</h3>
            <p class="test">
                I have researched European digital design companies and asked about their thoughts on digital
                sustainability. To my dismay, it turns out that none of them have that as their focus. Several hadn’t
                even heard of digital sustainability at all. And they work with web design on a daily basis! Disaster!  
                The companies "Your Majesty" and "Clever Franke" said that they cannot insist on sustainable designs
                when their customer has a different desire for the product. If they do this, their client will simply
                find another agency that can fulfill their design wishes. They also don’t come up with proposals for
                more sustainable solutions themselves, as they find it limiting in relation to design possibilities.
                  The Dutch company "Endeavor" had no idea what I was talking about when I asked about digital
                sustainability. I had to explain to them how polluting websites can be and how much focus there will be
                on this in the future. The employees at 'Endeavour' listened uncomprehendingly, as they too worried
                whether their customers would compromise their design in favor of sustainability. It will be exciting to
                see how they incorporate this new knowledge into their designs in the future.
